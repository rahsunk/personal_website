                    <a class="me all">I was born in May 2005 in New York. I am a mixed-raced individual, with African-American and Japanese heritage. I
                    maintain a decent understanding of Japanese, being able to read, write, and understand hiragana, katakana, romanji, and some kanji
                    characters.</a>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <a class="me all">From an early age, I've had a curious demeanor. </a><a class="env all">I was interested in the world around me.</a><a class="pc all">
                    I was interested in the technology around me.</a> I was specifically interested in the <a class="math all">mathematical</a> and<a class="pc all"> computational world.
                    </a><a class="me all"> I've demonstrated my love for these topics as a young child.</a><a class="math all"> I knew how to multiply and divide by the 1st grade.
                    </a><a class="env all"> I loved travelling to new and unique places.</a><a class="pc all"> And I taught myself how to use a computer and it's many software 
                    applications starting with our family's Windows XP computer.</a>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <a class="math all">As a teenager, math has remained one of my strongest subjects. I was widely regarded as the best student of my AP Calculus AB class,
                    consistently recieving near-perfect grades.</a><a class="pc all"> My computer skills have greatly improved, as I was able to learn several functions of computers
                    and their digital infrastructure. I began learning how to code with Python and Scratch, and have since expanded to other languages.</a><a class="env all"> I have also 
                    taken the duty of watching over and assisting my local community through environmental protection organizations, in which I have participated in internships and volunteer services.</a>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <a class="me all">Now, as a 17 year old high school student, I am ready to delve into a career that will allow me to practice my passions while improving
                    the lives of others around me. <a class="pc all">With my newfound knowledge of Snap!, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java,</a> along with my plans of <a class="math all">
                    my academic</a> and<a class="env all"> extra-curricular endeavors</a> in senior year, I wish to be employed in a part-time job and pursue higher education that makes use of my abilities.

            <div id="overview">
                <p id="width">I was born in May 2005 in New York City. I am a mixed-raced individual, with African-American and Japanese heritage. I
                    maintain a decent understanding of Japanese, being able to read, write, and understand hiragana, katakana, romanji, and some kanji
                    characters.
                    <br><br><br>
                    From an early age, I've had a curious demeanor. I was interested in the world around me. I was interested in the technology around
                    me. I was interested in the mathematical and computational world. I've demonstrated my love for these topics as a young child. I knew
                    how to multiply and divide by the 1st grade. I loved travelling to new and unique places. And I taught myself how to use a computer and
                    it's many software applications starting with our family's Windows XP computer.
                    <br><br><br>
                    As a teenager, math has remained one of my strongest subjects. I was widely regarded as the best student of my AP Calculus AB class,
                    consistently recieving near-perfect grades. My computer skills have greatly improved, as I was able to learn several more functions
                    of computers and their digital infrastructure, while learning how to code in Python and Scratch. I have also taken the duty of watching
                    over and assisting my local community through environmental protection organizations, in which I have participated in internships and
                    volunteer services.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Now, as a 17 year old high school student, I am ready to delve into a career that will allow me to practice my passions while improving
                    the lives of others around me. As I am currently learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also planning out my academic
                    and extra-cirricular endeavors in senior year, I wish to be employed in a part-time job soon, that makes use of my abilities.
